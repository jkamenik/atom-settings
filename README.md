# Atom Settings

Contains all my personal settings for the [Atom](http://atom.io) editor.

## Installation

```
$ cd ~
$ git clone git@github.com:<account>/atom-settings.git .atom
```

Since these are my setting, I recommend that you fork the repo into your own account and `git clone` from your version instead of mine.

## Packages

...

## Ungit
-----

[Ungit](https://github.com/FredrikNoren/ungit) is Git GUI written in node.  It will show up directly in atom if it is installed and you have the `atom-ungit` plugin.
